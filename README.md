# DBMS-
**Overview**
This project focuses on SQL database management and administration, structured into three parts. It builds on an Employee Database to tackle real-world challenges, enhancing database functionality, usability, and stability. Tasks included resolving supervisor-identified data issues, automating processes, and implementing advanced SQL features such as user-defined functions and stored procedures.

**Project 1: Orders Database and SQL Queries**
This phase involved designing and querying an eCommerce orders database using MS SQL Server Management Studio. The database comprised tables for customer orders, product details, and shipment methods.

Key Deliverables:

Database Schema Design: Developed and populated the Orders and Products databases with test data based on business requirements.
SQL Query Development: Constructed 20 advanced SQL queries, including equijoins, subqueries, and aggregations, to extract meaningful data like order totals and shipment details.
Referential Integrity: Ensured proper relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys.
Results: Captured and formatted query outputs for clear presentation.
Skills Applied:
**Complex SQL Querying (SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, Subqueries)**
**Schema Design and Data Validation**
**Referential Integrity Enforcement**

**Project 2: Employee Database and Management**
This part centered on creating and managing a human resources database for a growing company, incorporating data modeling and SQL scripting.

Key Tasks:

Data Modeling: Designed an ERD using crowâ€™s foot notation to map relationships between employees, departments, roles, and contacts.
Database Management: Wrote SQL scripts for table creation, data insertion, updates, and cleanup.
Advanced Queries: Built recursive queries to display manager-subordinate hierarchies and views to identify missing employee emergency contacts.
Testing: Verified database functionality and ensured constraints were properly implemented.
Skills Applied:
**Table Creation and SQL Scripting**
**ERD Design
Primary Key, Foreign Key, and Constraints Implementation
Maintenance and Data Integrity Testing**

**Project 3: SQL Database Administration**
This phase focused on refining and optimizing the database for better usability and performance.

Key Solutions:

Database Enhancements:

Modified the EmployeePersonal table to handle multiple allergies, improving insurance claim handling.
Introduced intersection tables to allow employees to record multiple addresses.
Strengthened PK-FK relationships between EmployeeAddress and Address tables, ensuring stability.
SQL Features:

Developed a user-defined function, LastNameFirst#, to format employee names.
Created a view, EmployeesMedicalConcerns, to track employees with allergies.
Proposed and implemented a stored procedure for formatting salary data with currency representation.
Performance Optimization:

Automated data cleansing processes with stored procedures to reduce manual intervention.
Addressed concurrency issues to prevent dirty reads and ensure smooth database operation.
Skills Applied:
**Advanced SQL Administration and Optimization
Writing and Testing Functions, Views, and Stored Procedures
Database Security, Integrity, and Maintenance
Concurrency Management**

**Technologies Used**
**SQL Server Management Studio
Microsoft Visio for Data Modeling
SQL for Database Operations and Maintenance**
